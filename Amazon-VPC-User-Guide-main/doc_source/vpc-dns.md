# DNS attributes for your VPC<a name="vpc-dns"></a>

Domain Name System \(DNS\) is a standard by which names used on the internet are resolved to their corresponding IP addresses\. A DNS hostname is a name that uniquely and absolutely names a computer; it's composed of a host name and a domain name\. DNS servers resolve DNS hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses\. 

Public IPv4 addresses enable communication over the internet, while private IPv4 addresses enable communication within the network of the instance\. For more information, see [IP addressing](how-it-works.md#vpc-ip-addressing)\.

Amazon provides a DNS server for \([the Amazon Route 53 Resolver](#AmazonDNS)\) for your VPC\. To use your own DNS server instead, create a new set of DHCP options for your VPC\. For more information, see [DHCP options sets in Amazon VPC](VPC_DHCP_Options.md)\.

## Amazon DNS server<a name="AmazonDNS"></a>

The default DHCP options set for your VPC includes two options:
+ `domain-name-servers=AmazonProvidedDNS`
+ `domain-name=`*domain\-name\-for\-your\-region*

AmazonProvidedDNS is an Amazon Route 53 Resolver server, and this option enables DNS for instances that need to communicate over the VPC's internet gateway\. The DNS server does not reside within a specific subnet or Availability Zone in a VPC\. The string `AmazonProvidedDNS` maps to a DNS server running on 169\.254\.169\.253 \(and the reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range, plus two\) and fd00:ec2::253\. For example, the DNS Server on a 10\.0\.0\.0/16 network is located at 10\.0\.0\.2\. For VPCs with multiple IPv4 CIDR blocks, the DNS server IP address is located in the primary CIDR block\.

When you launch an instance into a VPC, we provide the instance with a private DNS hostname\. We also provide a public DNS hostname if the instance is configured with a public IPv4 address and the VPC DNS attributes are enabled\.

The format of the private DNS hostname depends on how you configure the EC2 instance when you launch it\. For more information on the types of private DNS hostnames, see [EC2 instance naming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-naming.html)\.

The Amazon DNS server in your VPC is used to resolve the DNS domain names that you specify in a private hosted zone in Route 53\. For more information about private hosted zones, see [Working with private hosted zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

### Rules and considerations<a name="amazon-dns-rules"></a>

When using the Amazon DNS server, the following rules and considerations apply\.
+ You cannot filter traffic to or from the Amazon DNS server using network ACLs or security groups\.
+ Services that use the Hadoop framework, such as Amazon EMR, require instances to resolve their own fully qualified domain names \(FQDN\)\. In such cases, DNS resolution can fail if the `domain-name-servers` option is set to a custom value\. To ensure proper DNS resolution, consider adding a conditional forwarder on your DNS server to forward queries for the domain `region-name.compute.internal` to the Amazon DNS server\. For more information, see [Setting up a VPC to host clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-vpc-host-job-flows.html) in the *Amazon EMR Management Guide*\.
+ Windows Server 2008 disallows the use of a DNS server located in the link\-local address range \(169\.254\.0\.0/16\)\.
+ The Amazon Route 53 Resolver only supports recursive DNS queries\.

## DNS hostnames<a name="vpc-dns-hostnames"></a>

When you launch an instance, it always receives a private IPv4 address and a private DNS hostname that corresponds to its private IPv4 address\. If your instance has a public IPv4 address, the DNS attributes for its VPC determines whether it receives a public DNS hostname that corresponds to the public IPv4 address\. For more information, see [DNS attributes in your VPC](#vpc-dns-support)\.

With the Amazon provided DNS server enabled, DNS hostnames are assigned and resolved as follows\.

**Private IP DNS name \(IPv4 only\)**  
The IPBN\-based IPv4 DNS hostname that resolves to the private IPv4 address of the instance\. You can use the Private IP DNS name \(IPv4 only\) hostname for communication between instances in the same network, but we can't resolve the DNS hostname outside the network that the instance is in\. For more information about IPBN, see [EC2 instance hostname types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-naming.html)\.

**Private resource DNS name**  
The RBN\-based DNS name that can resolve to the A and AAAA DNS records selected for this instance\. This DNS hostname is visible in the instance details for instances in dual\-stack and IPv6\-only subnets\. For more information about RBN, see [EC2 instance hostname types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-naming.html)\.

**Public IPv4 DNS**  
A public \(external\) IPv4 DNS hostname takes the form `ec2-public-ipv4-address.compute-1.amazonaws.com` for the `us-east-1` Region, and `ec2-public-ipv4-address.region.compute.amazonaws.com` for other Regions\. The Amazon DNS server resolves a public DNS hostname to the public IPv4 address of the instance outside the network of the instance, and to the private IPv4 address of the instance from within the network of the instance\. For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses and external DNS hostnames](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## DNS attributes in your VPC<a name="vpc-dns-support"></a>

The following VPC attributes determine the DNS support provided for your VPC\. If both attributes are enabled, an instance launched into the VPC receives a public DNS hostname if it is assigned a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address at creation\. If you enable both attributes for a VPC that didn't previously have them both enabled, instances that were already launched into that VPC receive public DNS hostnames if they have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address\.

To check whether these attributes are enabled for your VPC, see [View and update DNS attributes for your VPC](#vpc-dns-updating)\.


| Attribute | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| enableDnsHostnames |  Determines whether the VPC supports assigning public DNS hostnames to instances with public IP addresses\. If both DNS attributes are `true`, instances in the VPC get public DNS hostnames\. The default for this attribute is `false` unless the VPC is a default VPC or the VPC was created using the VPC console wizard\.  | 
| enableDnsSupport |  Determines whether the VPC supports DNS resolution through the Amazon provided DNS server\. If this attribute is `true`, queries to the Amazon provided DNS server succeed\. For more information, see [Amazon DNS server](#AmazonDNS)\. The default for this attribute is `true`, no matter how the VPC is created\.  | 

**Rules and considerations**

The following rules apply\.
+ If both attributes are set to `true`, the following occurs:
  + Instances with public IP addresses receive corresponding public DNS hostnames\.
  + The Amazon Route 53 Resolver server can resolve Amazon\-provided private DNS hostnames\.
+ If at least one of the attributes is set to `false`, the following occurs:
  + Instances with public IP addresses do not receive corresponding public DNS hostnames\.
  + The Amazon Route 53 Resolver cannot resolve Amazon\-provided private DNS hostnames\.
  + Instances receive custom private DNS hostnames if there is a custom domain name in the [DHCP options set](VPC_DHCP_Options.md)\. If you are not using the Amazon Route 53 Resolver server, your custom domain name servers must resolve the hostname as appropriate\.
+ If you use custom DNS domain names defined in a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53, or use private DNS with interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\), you must set both the `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport` attributes to `true`\.
+ The Amazon Route 53 Resolver can resolve private DNS hostnames to private IPv4 addresses for all address spaces, including where the IPv4 address range of your VPC falls outside of the private IPv4 addresses ranges specified by [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)\. However, if you created your VPC before October 2016, the Amazon Route 53 Resolver does not resolve private DNS hostnames if your VPC's IPv4 address range falls outside of these ranges\. To enable support for this, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/)\.

## DNS quotas<a name="vpc-dns-limits"></a>

Each EC2 instance can send 1024 packets per second per network interface to Route 53 Resolver \(specifically the \.2 address, such as 10\.0\.0\.2, and 169\.254\.169\.253\)\. This quota cannot be increased\. The number of DNS queries per second supported by Route 53 Resolver varies by the type of query, the size of the response, and the protocol in use\. For more information and recommendations for a scalable DNS architecture, see the [AWS Hybrid DNS with Active Directory](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-hybrid-dns-with-active-directory.pdf) Technical Guide\.

If you reach the quota, the Route 53 Resolver rejects traffic\. Some of the causes for reaching the quota might be a DNS throttling issue, or instance metadata queries that use the Route 53 Resolver network interface\. For information about how to solve VPC DNS throttling issues, see [How can I determine whether my DNS queries to the Amazon provided DNS server are failing due to VPC DNS throttling](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/vpc-find-cause-of-failed-dns-queries/)\. For information about instance metadata retrieval, see [Retrieve instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## Private hosted zones<a name="vpc-private-hosted-zones"></a>

To access the resources in your VPC using custom DNS domain names, such as `example.com`, instead of using private IPv4 addresses or AWS\-provided private DNS hostnames, you can create a private hosted zone in Route 53\. A private hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more VPCs without exposing your resources to the internet\. You can then create Route 53 resource record sets, which determine how Route 53 responds to queries for your domain and subdomains\. For example, if you want browser requests for example\.com to be routed to a web server in your VPC, you'll create an A record in your private hosted zone and specify the IP address of that web server\. For more information about creating a private hosted zone, see [Working with private hosted zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

To access resources using custom DNS domain names, you must be connected to an instance within your VPC\. From your instance, you can test that your resource in your private hosted zone is accessible from its custom DNS name by using the `ping` command; for example, `ping mywebserver.example.com`\. \(You must ensure that your instance's security group rules allow inbound ICMP traffic for the `ping` command to work\.\)

You can access a private hosted zone from an EC2\-Classic instance that is linked to your VPC using ClassicLink, provided your VPC is enabled for ClassicLink DNS support\. For more information, see [Enabling ClassicLink DNS support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-classiclink.html#classiclink-enable-dns-support) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. Otherwise, private hosted zones do not support transitive relationships outside of the VPC; for example, you cannot access your resources using their custom private DNS names from the other side of a VPN connection\. For more information, see [ClassicLink limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-classiclink.html#classiclink-limitations) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

**Important**  
If you use custom DNS domain names defined in a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53, the `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport` attributes must be set to `true`\.

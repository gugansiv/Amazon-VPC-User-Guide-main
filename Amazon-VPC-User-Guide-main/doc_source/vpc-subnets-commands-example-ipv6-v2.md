# Create an IPv6\-enabled VPC and IPv6\-only subnets using the AWS CLI<a name="vpc-subnets-commands-example-ipv6-v2"></a>

The following example uses AWS CLI commands to create a nondefault VPC with an IPv6 CIDR block, a public IPv6\-only subnet, and a private IPv6\-only subnet with outbound internet access only\. After you've created the VPC and subnets, you can launch an instance in the public subnet and connect to it\. You can launch an instance in your private subnet and verify that it can connect to the internet\. To begin, you must first install and configure the AWS CLI\. For more information, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html)\.

You will create the following AWS resources:
+ A VPC
+ Two subnets
+ An internet gateway
+ A route table
+ An EC2 instance

## Step 1: Create a VPC and subnets<a name="vpc-subnets-commands-example-create-ipv6-vpc-v2"></a>

The first step is to create a VPC\. You are required to define an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC even though we are primarily focussed on IPv6 in this example\. This example uses the IPv4 CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16` for the VPC, but you can choose a different CIDR block\. For more information, see [VPC sizing](configure-your-vpc.md#vpc-sizing)\.

**To create a VPC and subnets using the AWS CLI**

1. Create a VPC with a `10.0.0.0/16` CIDR block and associate an IPv6 CIDR block with the VPC\. 

   ```
   aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --amazon-provided-ipv6-cidr-block
   ```

   In the output that's returned, take note of the VPC ID\. 

   ```
   {
       "Vpc": {
           "VpcId": "vpc-2f09a348", 
           ...
   }
   ```

1. Describe your VPC to get the IPv6 CIDR block that's associated with the VPC\. 

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-vpcs --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348
   ```

   ```
   {
       "Vpcs": [
           {
               ...
               "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet": [
                   {
                       "Ipv6CidrBlock": "2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56", 
                       "AssociationId": "vpc-cidr-assoc-17a5407e", 
                       "Ipv6CidrBlockState": {
                           "State": "ASSOCIATED"
                       }
                   }
               ], 
               ...
   }
   ```

1. Create an IPv6\-only subnet in your VPC with a `2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64` IPv6 CIDR block \(from the ranges that were returned in the previous step\)\. For more information about the IPv6\-only option, see [Create a subnet in your VPC](working-with-subnets.md#create-subnets) or [create\-subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-subnet.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348 --ipv6-cidr-block 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64 --ipv6-native
   ```

1. Create a second IPv6\-only subnet in your VPC with a `2001:db8:1234:1a01::/64` IPv6 CIDR block\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348 --ipv6-cidr-block 2001:db8:1234:1a01::/64 --ipv6-native
   ```

## Step 2: Configure a public subnet<a name="vpc-subnets-commands-example-public-subnet-ipv6-v2"></a>

After you've created the VPC and subnets, you can make one of the IPv6 subnets a public subnet by attaching an internet gateway to your VPC, creating a custom route table, and configuring routing for the subnet to the internet gateway\. In this example, a route table is created that routes all IPv6 traffic to an internet gateway\.

**To make your subnet a public subnet**

1. Create an internet gateway\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-internet-gateway
   ```

   In the output that's returned, take note of the internet gateway ID\.

   ```
   {
       "InternetGateway": {
           ...
           "InternetGatewayId": "igw-1ff7a07b", 
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

1. Using the ID from the previous step, attach the internet gateway to your VPC\.

   ```
   aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348 --internet-gateway-id igw-1ff7a07b
   ```

1. Create a custom route table for your VPC\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348
   ```

   In the output that's returned, take note of the route table ID\.

   ```
   {
       "RouteTable": {
           ... 
           "RouteTableId": "rtb-c1c8faa6", 
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

1. Create a route in the route table that points all IPv6 traffic \(`::/0`\) to the internet gateway\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-c1c8faa6 --destination-ipv6-cidr-block ::/0 --gateway-id igw-1ff7a07b
   ```

1. To confirm that your route has been created and is active, you can describe the route table and view the results\.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-route-tables --route-table-id rtb-c1c8faa6
   ```

   ```
   {
       "RouteTables": [
           {
               "Associations": [], 
               "RouteTableId": "rtb-c1c8faa6", 
               "VpcId": "vpc-2f09a348", 
               "PropagatingVgws": [], 
               "Tags": [], 
               "Routes": [
                   {
                       "GatewayId": "local", 
                       "DestinationCidrBlock": "10.0.0.0/16", 
                       "State": "active", 
                       "Origin": "CreateRouteTable"
                   }, 
                   {
                       "GatewayId": "local", 
                       "Origin": "CreateRouteTable", 
                       "State": "active", 
                       "DestinationIpv6CidrBlock": "2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56"
                   }, 
                   {
                       "GatewayId": "igw-1ff7a07b", 
                       "Origin": "CreateRoute", 
                       "State": "active", 
                       "DestinationIpv6CidrBlock": "::/0"
                   }
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. The route table is not currently associated with any subnet\. Associate it with a subnet in your VPC so that traffic from that subnet is routed to the internet gateway\. First, describe your subnets to get their IDs\. You can use the `--filter` option to return the subnets for your new VPC only, and the `--query` option to return only the subnet IDs and their IPv6 CIDR blocks\.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-2f09a348" --query "Subnets[*].{ID:SubnetId,IPv6CIDR:Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet[*].Ipv6CidrBlock}"
   ```

   ```
   [
       {
           "ID": "subnet-b46032ec", 
           "IPv6CIDR": [
               "2001:db8:1234:1a01::/64"
           ], 
           "ID": "subnet-a46032fc", 
           "IPv6CIDR": [
               "2001:db8:1234:1a01::/64"
       }
   ]
   ```

1. You can choose which subnet to associate with the custom route table, for example, `subnet-b46032ec`\. This subnet will be your public subnet\.

   ```
   aws ec2 associate-route-table  --subnet-id subnet-b46032ec --route-table-id rtb-c1c8faa6
   ```

## Step 3: Configure an egress\-only private subnet<a name="vpc-subnets-commands-example-private-subnet-ipv6-v2"></a>

You can configure the second subnet in your VPC to be an IPv6 egress\-only private subnet\. Instances that are launched in this subnet are able to access the internet over IPv6 \(for example, to get software updates\) through an egress\-only internet gateway, but hosts on the internet cannot reach your instances\. 

**To make your subnet an egress\-only private subnet**

1. Create an egress\-only internet gateway for your VPC\. In the output that's returned, take note of the gateway ID\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-egress-only-internet-gateway --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348
   ```

   ```
   {
       "EgressOnlyInternetGateway": {
           "EgressOnlyInternetGatewayId": "eigw-015e0e244e24dfe8a", 
           "Attachments": [
               {
                   "State": "attached", 
                   "VpcId": "vpc-2f09a348"
               }
           ]
       }
   }
   ```

1. Create a custom route table for your VPC\. In the output that's returned, take note of the route table ID\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348
   ```

1. Create a route in the route table that points all IPv6 traffic \(`::/0`\) to the egress\-only Internet gateway\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-abc123ab --destination-ipv6-cidr-block ::/0 --egress-only-internet-gateway-id eigw-015e0e244e24dfe8a
   ```

1. Associate the route table with the second subnet in your VPC \(you described the subnets in the previous section\)\. This subnet will be your private subnet with egress\-only IPv6 internet access\.

   ```
   aws ec2 associate-route-table --subnet-id subnet-a46032fc --route-table-id rtb-abc123ab
   ```

## Step 4: Modify the subnets<a name="vpc-subnets-commands-example-subnet-addressing-v2"></a>

Once you've created the subnets, you can modify the following:
+ The IP addressing behavior of your subnets so that instances launched into the subnets automatically receive IPv6 addresses\. As a result, when you launch an instance into the subnet, a single IPv6 address is assigned from the range of the subnet to the primary network interface \(eth0\) of the instance\.
+ Resource\-based Name \(RBN\) settings for the subnet and instances launched into the subnet\. For more information on RBN, see [Amazon EC2 instance hostname types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-naming.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\. For details on the RBN options used in this section, see [modify\-subnet\-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-subnet-attribute.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference* or [Modifying RBN configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-naming.html#instance-naming-modify) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\.

```
aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id subnet-b46032ec --assign-ipv6-address-on-creation --private-dns-hostname-type-on-launch resource-name --enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record-on-launch --enable-resource-name-dns-a-record-on-launch
```

```
aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id subnet-a46032fc --assign-ipv6-address-on-creation --private-dns-hostname-type-on-launch resource-name --enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record-on-launch --enable-resource-name-dns-a-record-on-launch
```

## Step 5: Launch an instance into your public subnet<a name="vpc-subnets-commands-example-launch-instance-ipv6-v2"></a>

To test that your public subnet is public and that instances in the subnet are accessible from the internet, launch an instance into your public subnet and connect to it\. First, you must create a security group to associate with your instance, and a key pair with which you'll connect to your instance\. For more information about security groups, see [Control traffic to resources using security groups](VPC_SecurityGroups.md)\. For more information about key pairs, see [Amazon EC2 key pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

For details on the options available when you run an instance, see [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference* or [Launch an instance using the Launch Instance Wizard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\.

**To launch and connect to an instance in your public subnet**

1. Create a key pair and use the `--query` option and the `--output` text option to pipe your private key directly into a file with the `.pem` extension\. 

   ```
   aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name MyKeyPair --query "KeyMaterial" --output text > MyKeyPair.pem
   ```

   In this example, launch an Amazon Linux instance\. If you use an SSH client on a Linux or OS X operating system to connect to your instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it\.

   ```
   chmod 400 MyKeyPair.pem
   ```

1. Create a security group for your VPC using the [create\-security\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-security-group.html) command\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name SSHAccess --description "Security group for SSH access" --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348
   ```

   ```
   {
       "GroupId": "sg-e1fb8c9a"
   }
   ```

   Add a rule that allows SSH access from any IPv6 address using the [authorize\-security\-group\-ingress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/authorize-security-group-ingress.html) command\. Note that the following syntax works only on Linux and macOS\. For syntax that works on Windows, see the [examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/authorize-security-group-ingress.html#examples) section in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

   ```
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-e1fb8c9a --ip-permissions '[{"IpProtocol": "tcp", "FromPort": 22, "ToPort": 22, "Ipv6Ranges": [{"CidrIpv6": "::/0"}]}]'
   ```
**Note**  
If you use `::/0`, you enable all IPv6 addresses to access your instance using SSH\. This is acceptable for this short exercise, but in production, authorize only a specific IP address or range of addresses to access your instance\.

1. Launch an IPv6\-only EC2 instance into your public subnet using the security group and key pair that you've created\. To launch an IPv6\-only EC2 instance, you must use [EC2 instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances)\. For more information, see [Amazon DNS server](vpc-dns.md#AmazonDNS)\. In the output, take note of the instance ID for your instance\.

   ```
   aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0de53d8956e8dcf80 --count 1 --instance-type t3.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --security-group-ids sg-e1fb8c9a --subnet-id subnet-b46032ec
   ```
**Note**  
In this example, the AMI is an Amazon Linux AMI in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region\. If you're in a different Region, you need the AMI ID for a suitable AMI in your Region\. For more information, see [Find a Linux AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

1. Your instance must be in the `running` state in order to connect to it\. Describe your instance and confirm its state, and take note of its IPv6 address\.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-id i-0146854b7443af453
   ```

   The following is example output\.

   ```
   {
       "Reservations": [
           {
               ... 
               "Instances": [
                   {
                       ...
                       "State": {
                           "Code": 16, 
                           "Name": "running"
                       }, 
                       ...
                       "NetworkInterfaces": {
                           "Ipv6Addresses": {
                               "Ipv6Address": "2001:db8:1234:1a00::123"
                           } 
                       ...
                   }
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. When your instance is in the running state, you can connect to it using an SSH client on a Linux or OS X computer by using the following command\. Your local computer must have an IPv6 address configured\.

   ```
   ssh -i "MyKeyPair.pem" ec2-user@2001:db8:1234:1a00::123
   ```

   If you're connecting from a Windows computer, use the following instructions: [Connecting to your Linux instance from Windows using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html)\.

## Step 6: Launch an instance into your private subnet<a name="vpc-subnets-commands-example-launch-instance-ipv6-private-v2"></a>

To test that instances in your egress\-only private subnet can access the internet, launch an instance in your private subnet and connect to it using a bastion instance in your public subnet \(you can use the instance you launched in the previous section\)\. First, you must create a security group for the instance\. The security group must have a rule that allows your bastion instance to connect using SSH, and a rule that allows the `ping6` command \(ICMPv6 traffic\) to verify that the instance is not accessible from the internet\.

1. Create a security group in your VPC using the [create\-security\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-security-group.html) command\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name SSHAccessRestricted --description "Security group for SSH access from bastion" --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348
   ```

   Add a rule that allows inbound SSH access from the IPv6 address of the instance in your public subnet, and a rule that allows all ICMPv6 traffic using the [authorize\-security\-group\-ingress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/authorize-security-group-ingress.html) command\. Note that the following syntax works only on Linux and macOS\. For syntax that works on Windows, see the [examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/authorize-security-group-ingress.html#examples) section in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

   ```
   {
       "GroupId": "sg-aabb1122"
   }
   ```

   ```
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-aabb1122 --ip-permissions '[{"IpProtocol": "tcp", "FromPort": 22, "ToPort": 22, "Ipv6Ranges": [{"CidrIpv6": "2001:db8:1234:1a00::123/128"}]}]'
   ```

   ```
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-aabb1122 --ip-permissions '[{"IpProtocol": "58", "FromPort": -1, "ToPort": -1, "Ipv6Ranges": [{"CidrIpv6": "::/0"}]}]'
   ```

1. Launch an IPv6\-only instance into your private subnet, using the security group you've created and the same key pair you used to launch the instance in the public subnet\. To launch an IPv6\-only EC2 instance, you must use [EC2 instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances)\.

   ```
   aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-a4827dc9 --count 1 --instance-type t3.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --security-group-ids sg-aabb1122 --subnet-id subnet-a46032fc
   ```

   Use the `describe-instances` command to verify that your instance is running, and to get its IPv6 address\.

1. Configure SSH agent forwarding on your local machine, and then connect to your instance in the public subnet\.

   For Linux, use the following commands:

   ```
   ssh-add MyKeyPair.pem
   ssh -A ec2-user@2001:db8:1234:1a00::123
   ```

   For OS X, use the following commands:

   ```
   ssh-add -K MyKeyPair.pem
   ssh -A ec2-user@2001:db8:1234:1a00::123
   ```

   For Windows, use the following instructions: [To configure SSH agent forwarding for Windows \(PuTTY\)](nat-gateway-scenarios.md#ssh-forwarding-windows)\. Connect to the instance in the public subnet by using its IPv6 address\.

1. From your instance in the public subnet \(the bastion instance\), connect to your instance in the private subnet by using its IPv6 address:

   ```
   ssh ec2-user@2001:db8:1234:1a01::456
   ```

1. From your private instance, test that you can connect to the internet by running the `ping6` command for a website that has ICMP enabled, for example:

   ```
   ping6 -n ietf.org
   ```

   ```
   PING ietf.org(2001:1900:3001:11::2c) 56 data bytes
   64 bytes from 2001:1900:3001:11::2c: icmp_seq=1 ttl=46 time=73.9 ms
   64 bytes from 2001:1900:3001:11::2c: icmp_seq=2 ttl=46 time=73.8 ms
   64 bytes from 2001:1900:3001:11::2c: icmp_seq=3 ttl=46 time=73.9 ms
   ...
   ```

1. To test that hosts on the internet cannot reach your instance in the private subnet, use the `ping6` command from a computer that's enabled for IPv6\. You should get a timeout response\. If you get a valid response, then your instance is accessible from the internet—check the route table that's associated with your private subnet and verify that it does not have a route for IPv6 traffic to an internet gateway\.

   ```
   ping6 2001:db8:1234:1a01::456

## Step 7: Clean up<a name="vpc-subnets-commands-example-clean-up-ipv6-v2"></a>

After you've verified that you can connect to your instance in the public subnet and that your instance in the private subnet can access the internet, you can terminate the instances if you no longer need them\. To do this, use the [terminate\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/terminate-instances.html) command\. To delete the other resources you've created in this example, use the following commands in their listed order:

1. Delete your security groups:

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id sg-e1fb8c9a
   ```

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id sg-aabb1122
   ```

1. Delete your subnets:

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-subnet --subnet-id subnet-b46032ec
   ```

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-subnet --subnet-id subnet-a46032fc
   ```

1. Delete your custom route tables:

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-route-table --route-table-id rtb-c1c8faa6
   ```

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-route-table --route-table-id rtb-abc123ab
   ```

1. Detach your internet gateway from your VPC:

   ```
   aws ec2 detach-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id igw-1ff7a07b --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348
   ```

1. Delete your internet gateway:

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id igw-1ff7a07b
   ```

1. Delete your egress\-only internet gateway:

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-egress-only-internet-gateway  --egress-only-internet-gateway-id eigw-015e0e244e24dfe8a
   ```

1. Delete your VPC:

   ```
   aws ec2 delete-vpc --vpc-id vpc-2f09a348
   ```

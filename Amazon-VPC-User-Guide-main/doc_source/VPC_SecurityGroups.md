# Control traffic to resources using security groups<a name="VPC_SecurityGroups"></a>

A *security group* acts as a virtual firewall, controlling the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with\. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance\.

When you create a VPC, it comes with a default security group\. You can create additional security groups for each VPC\. You can associate a security group only with resources in the VPC for which it is created\.

For each security group, you add *rules* that control the traffic based on protocols and port numbers\. There are separate sets of rules for inbound traffic and outbound traffic\.

You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC\. For more information about the differences between security groups and network ACLs, see [Compare security groups and network ACLs](VPC_Security.md#VPC_Security_Comparison)\.

## Security group basics<a name="VPCSecurityGroups"></a>

The following are the characteristics of security groups:
+ When you create a security group, you must provide it with a name and a description\. The following rules apply:
  + A security group name must be unique within the VPC\.
  + Names and descriptions can be up to 255 characters in length\.
  + Names and descriptions are limited to the following characters: a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9, spaces, and \.\_\-:/\(\)\#,@\[\]\+=&;\{\}\!$\*\.
  + When the name contains trailing spaces, we trim the space at the end of the name\. For example, if you enter "Test Security Group " for the name, we store it as "Test Security Group"\.
  + A security group name cannot start with `sg-`\.
+ Security groups are stateful\. For example, if you send a request from an instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to reach the instance regardless of the inbound security group rules\. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to leave the instance, regardless of the outbound rules\.
+ There are quotas on the number of security groups that you can create per VPC, the number of rules that you can add to each security group, and the number of security groups that you can associate with a network interface\. For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](amazon-vpc-limits.md)\.

The following are the characteristics of security group rules:
+ You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules\.
+ When you first create a security group, it has no inbound rules\. Therefore, no inbound traffic is allowed until you add inbound rules to the security group\.
+ When you first create a security group, it has an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic from the resource\. You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that allow specific outbound traffic only\. If your security group has no outbound rules, no outbound traffic is allowed\.
+ When you associate multiple security groups with a resource, the rules from each security group are aggregated to form a single set of rules that are used to determine whether to allow access\.
+ When you add, update, or remove rules, your changes are automatically applied to all resources associated with the security group\. The effect of some rule changes can depend on how the traffic is tracked\. For more information, see [Connection tracking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#security-group-connection-tracking) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
+ When you create a security group rule, AWS assigns a unique ID to the rule\. You can use the ID of a rule when you use the API or CLI to modify or delete the rule\.

## Default security groups for your VPCs<a name="DefaultSecurityGroup"></a>

Your default VPCs and any VPCs that you create come with a default security group\. With some resources, if you don't associate a security group when you create the resource, we associate the default security group\. For example, if you do not specify a security group when you launch an EC2 instance, we associate the default security group \.

You can change the rules for a default security group\. You can't delete a default security group\. If you try to delete the default security group, you get the following error: `Client.CannotDelete`\.

The following table describes the default rules for a default security group\.


| 
| 
| Inbound | 
| --- |
|  Source  |  Protocol  |  Port range  |  Description  | 
|  The security group ID \(its own resource ID\)  |  All  |  All  |  Allows inbound traffic from resources that are assigned to the same security group\.  | 
|   Outbound   | 
| --- |
|  Destination  |  Protocol  |  Port range  |  Description  | 
|  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  All  |  All  |  Allows all outbound IPv4 traffic\.  | 
| ::/0 | All | All | Allows all outbound IPv6 traffic\. This rule is added only if your VPC has an associated IPv6 CIDR block\. | 

## Security group rules<a name="SecurityGroupRules"></a>

The rules of a security group control the inbound traffic that's allowed to reach the resources that are associated with the security group\. The rules also control the outbound traffic that's allowed to leave them\.

You can add or remove rules for a security group \(also referred to as *authorizing* or *revoking* inbound or outbound access\)\. A rule applies either to inbound traffic \(ingress\) or outbound traffic \(egress\)\. You can grant access to a specific CIDR range, or to another security group in your VPC or in a peer VPC \(requires a VPC peering connection\)\.

For each rule, you specify the following:
+ **Protocol**: The protocol to allow\. The most common protocols are 6 \(TCP\), 17 \(UDP\), and 1 \(ICMP\)\.
+ **Port range**: For TCP, UDP, or a custom protocol, the range of ports to allow\. You can specify a single port number \(for example, `22`\), or range of port numbers \(for example, `7000-8000`\)\.
+ **ICMP type and code**: For ICMP, the ICMP type and code\. For example, use type 8 for ICMP Echo Request or type 128 for ICMPv6 Echo Request\.
+ **Source or destination**: The source \(inbound rules\) or destination \(outbound rules\) for the traffic to allow\. Specify one of the following:
  + A single IPv4 address\. You must use the `/32` prefix length\. For example, `203.0.113.1/32`\. 
  + A single IPv6 address\. You must use the `/128` prefix length\. For example, `2001:db8:1234:1a00::123/128`\.
  + A range of IPv4 addresses, in CIDR block notation\. For example, `203.0.113.0/24`\.
  + A range of IPv6 addresses, in CIDR block notation\. For example, `2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64`\.
  + The ID of a prefix list\. For example, `pl-1234abc1234abc123`\. For more information, see [Group CIDR blocks using prefix lists](managed-prefix-lists.md)\.
  + The ID of a security group \(referred to here as the specified security group\)\. For example, the current security group, a security group from the same VPC, or a security group for a peered VPC\. This allows traffic based on the private IP addresses of the resources associated with the specified security group\. This does not add rules from the specified security group to the current security group\. †
+ **\(Optional\) Description**: You can add a description for the rule, which can help you identify it later\. A description can be up to 255 characters in length\. Allowed characters are a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9, spaces, and \.\_\-:/\(\)\#,@\[\]\+=;\{\}\!$\*\.

† If you configure routes to forward the traffic between two instances in different subnets through a middlebox appliance, you must ensure that the security groups for both instances allow traffic to flow between the instances\. The security group for each instance must reference the private IP address of the other instance, or the CIDR range of the subnet that contains the other instance, as the source\. If you reference the security group of the other instance as the source, this does not allow traffic to flow between the instances\.

### Example rules<a name="security-group-rule-examples"></a>

The rules that you add to a security group often depend on the purpose of the security group\. The following table describes example rules for a security group that's associated with web servers\. Your web servers can receive HTTP and HTTPS traffic from all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and send SQL or MySQL traffic to your database servers\.


| 
| 
| Inbound | 
| --- |
|  Source  |  Protocol  |  Port range  |  Description  | 
|  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  TCP  |  80  |  Allows inbound HTTP access from all IPv4 addresses  | 
| ::/0 | TCP | 80 | Allows inbound HTTP access from all IPv6 addresses | 
|  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  TCP  |  443  |  Allows inbound HTTPS access from all IPv4 addresses  | 
| ::/0 | TCP | 443 | Allows inbound HTTPS access from all IPv6 addresses | 
|  Your network's public IPv4 address range  |  TCP  |  22  |  Allows inbound SSH access from IPv4 IP addresses in your network  | 
|  Your network's public IPv4 address range  |  TCP  |  3389  |  Allows inbound RDP access from IPv4 IP addresses in your network  | 
|   Outbound   | 
| --- |
|  Destination  |  Protocol  |  Port range  |  Description  | 
|  The ID of the security group for your Microsoft SQL Server database servers  |  TCP  |  1433  |  Allow outbound Microsoft SQL Server access  | 
|  The ID of the security group for your MySQL database servers  |  TCP  |  3306  |  Allow outbound MySQL access  | 

A database server needs a different set of rules\. For example, instead of inbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic, you can add a rule that allows inbound MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server access\. For examples, see [Security](VPC_Scenario3.md#VPC_Scenario3_Security)\. For more information about security groups for Amazon RDS DB instances, see [Controlling access with security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html) in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*\.

For additional examples, see [Security group rules reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules-reference.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

### Stale security group rules<a name="vpc-stale-security-group-rules"></a>

If your VPC has a VPC peering connection with another VPC, or if it uses a VPC shared by another account, a security group rule in your VPC can reference a security group in that peer VPC or shared VPC\. This allows resources that are associated with the referenced security group and those that are associated with the referencing security group to communicate with each other\.

If the security group in the shared VPC is deleted, or if the VPC peering connection is deleted, the security group rule is marked as stale\. You can delete stale security group rules as you would any other security group rule\. For more information, see [Work with stale security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-security-groups.html#vpc-peering-stale-groups) in the *Amazon VPC Peering Guide*\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**\.

1. Select the security group\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Edit inbound rules** or **Actions**, **Edit outbound rules**\.

1. For each rule, choose **Add rule** and do the following\.

   1. For **Type**, choose the type of protocol to allow\.
      + For TCP or UDP, you must enter the port range to allow\.
      + For custom ICMP, you must choose the ICMP type name from **Protocol**, and, if applicable, the code name from **Port range**\.
      + For any other type, the protocol and port range are configured automatically\.

   1. For **Source** \(inbound rules\) or **Destination** \(outbound rules\), do one of the following to allow traffic:
      + Choose **Custom** and then enter an IP address in CIDR notation, a CIDR block, another security group, or a prefix list\.
      + Choose **Anywhere** to allow traffic from any IP address \(inbound rules\) or to allow traffic to reach all IP addresses \(outbound rules\)\. This automatically adds a rule for the 0\.0\.0\.0/0 IPv4 CIDR block\.

        If your security group is in a VPC that's enabled for IPv6, this automatically adds a rule for the ::/0 IPv6 CIDR block\.

        For inbound rules, this option is acceptable for a short time in a test environment, but is unsafe for production environments\. In production, authorize access only for a specific IP address or range of IP addresses\.
      + Choose **My IP** to allow traffic only from \(inbound rules\) or to \(outbound rules\) your local computer's public IPv4 address\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, specify a brief description for the rule\.

## Centrally manage VPC security groups using AWS Firewall Manager<a name="aws-firewall-manager"></a>

AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your VPC security groups administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources\. With Firewall Manager, you can configure and audit your security groups for your organization from a single central administrator account\. Firewall Manager automatically applies the rules and protections across your accounts and resources, even as you add new resources\. Firewall Manager is particularly useful when you want to protect your entire organization, or if you frequently add new resources that you want to protect from a central administrator account\.

You can use Firewall Manager to centrally manage security groups in the following ways:
+ **Configure common baseline security groups across your organization**: You can use a common security group policy to provide a centrally controlled association of security groups to accounts and resources across your organization\. You specify where and how to apply the policy in your organization\.
+ **Audit existing security groups in your organization**: You can use an audit security group policy to check the existing rules that are in use in your organization's security groups\. You can scope the policy to audit all accounts, specific accounts, or resources tagged within your organization\. Firewall Manager automatically detects new accounts and resources and audits them\. You can create audit rules to set guardrails on which security group rules to allow or disallow within your organization, and to check for unused or redundant security groups\. 
+ **Get reports on non\-compliant resources and remediate them**: You can get reports and alerts for non\-compliant resources for your baseline and audit policies\. You can also set auto\-remediation workflows to remediate any non\-compliant resources that Firewall Manager detects\.

To learn more about using Firewall Manager to manage your security groups, see the following topics in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide*:

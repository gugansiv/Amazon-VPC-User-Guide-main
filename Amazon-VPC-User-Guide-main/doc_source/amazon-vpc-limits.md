# Amazon VPC quotas<a name="amazon-vpc-limits"></a>

The following tables list the quotas, formerly referred to as limits, for Amazon VPC resources per Region for your AWS account\. Unless indicated otherwise, you can request an increase for these quotas\. For some of these quotas, you can view your current quota using the **Limits** page of the Amazon EC2 console\.

If you request a quota increase that applies per resource, we increase the quota for all resources in the Region\. 

## VPC and subnets<a name="vpc-limits-vpcs-subnets"></a>


| Name | Default | Adjustable | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| VPCs per Region | 5 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-F678F1CE) |  Increasing this quota increases the quota on internet gateways per Region by the same amount\. You can increase this limit so that you can have 100s of VPCs per Region\.  | 
| Subnets per VPC | 200 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-407747CB) |  | 
| IPv4 CIDR blocks per VPC | 5 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-83CA0A9D) \(up to 50\) | This primary CIDR block and all secondary CIDR blocks count toward this quota\. | 
| IPv6 CIDR blocks per VPC | 1 | No |  | 

## DNS<a name="vpc-limits-dns"></a>

Each EC2 instance can send 1024 packets per second per network interface to Route 53 Resolver \(specifically the \.2 address, such as 10\.0\.0\.2, and 169\.254\.169\.253\)\. This quota cannot be increased\. The number of DNS queries per second supported by Route 53 Resolver varies by the type of query, the size of the response, and the protocol in use\. For more information and recommendations for a scalable DNS architecture, see the [AWS Hybrid DNS with Active Directory](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-hybrid-dns-with-active-directory.pdf) Technical Guide\.

| Egress\-only internet gateways per Region | 5 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-45FE3B85) | To increase this quota, increase the quota on VPCs per Region\. You can attach only one egress\-only internet gateway to a VPC at a time\. | 
| Internet gateways per Region | 5 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-A4707A72) | To increase this quota, increase the quota on VPCs per Region\. You can attach only one internet gateway to a VPC at a time\.  | 
| NAT gateways per Availability Zone | 5 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-FE5A380F) | NAT gateways count toward your quota in the pending, active, or deleting state\. | 
| Carrier gateways per VPC | 1 | No |  | 

## Customer\-managed prefix lists<a name="vpc-quotas-managed-prefix-lists"></a>

**Note**  
While the default quotas for customer\-managed prefix lists are adjustable, you cannot adjust the quotas using the Service Quotas console\. You must contact the AWS Support Center as described in [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.


| Name | Default | Adjustable | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Prefix lists per Region | 100 | Yes |  | 
| Versions per prefix list | 1,000 | Yes | If a prefix list has 1,000 stored versions and you add a new version, the oldest version is removed so that the new version can be added\. | 
| Maximum number of entries per prefix list | 1,000 | Yes |  The default quota for customer\-managed prefix lists is 10 unless you resize the prefix list\. You can resize it up to 1000\. For more information, see [Resize a prefix list](working-with-managed-prefix-lists.md#resize-managed-prefix-list)\. When you reference a prefix list in a resource, the maximum number of entries for the prefix lists counts against the quota for the number of entries for the resource\. For example, if you create a prefix list with 20 maximum entries and you reference that prefix list in a security group rule, this counts as 20 security group rules\.  | 
| References to a prefix list per resource type | 5,000 | Yes | This quota applies per resource type that can reference a prefix list\. For example, you can have 5,000 references to a prefix list across all of your security groups plus 5,000 references to a prefix list across all of your subnet route tables\. If you share a prefix list with other AWS accounts, the other accounts' references to your prefix list count toward this quota\. | 

## Network ACLs<a name="vpc-limits-nacls"></a>


| Name | Default | Adjustable | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Network ACLs per VPC | 200 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-B4A6D682) | You can associate one network ACL to one or more subnets in a VPC\. | 
| Rules per network ACL | 20 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-2AEEBF1A) | This is the one\-way quota for a single network ACL\. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 rules and IPv6 rules; for example, you can have 20 ingress rules for IPv4 traffic and 20 ingress rules for IPv6 traffic\. This quota includes the default deny rules \(rule number 32767 for IPv4 and 32768 for IPv6, or an asterisk \* in the Amazon VPC console\)\. This quota can be increased up to a maximum of 40; however, network performance might be impacted due to the increased workload to process the additional rules\.  | 

## Network interfaces<a name="vpc-limits-enis"></a>


| Name | Default | Adjustable | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Network interfaces per instance | Varies by instance type | No | For more information, see [Network interfaces per instance type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI)\. |

| Routes per route table \(non\-propagated routes\) | 50 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-93826ACB) | You can increase this quota up to a maximum of 1,000; however, network performance might be impacted\. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 routes and IPv6 routes\. If you have more than 125 routes, we recommend that you paginate calls to describe your route tables for better performance\. | 
| BGP advertised routes per route table \(propagated routes\) | 100 | No | If you require additional prefixes, advertise a default route\. | 

## Security groups<a name="vpc-limits-security-groups"></a>


| Name | Default | Adjustable | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| VPC security groups per Region | 2,500 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-E79EC296) | This quota applies to individual AWS account VPCs and shared VPCs\. If you increase this quota to more than 5,000 security groups in a Region, we recommend that you paginate calls to describe your security groups for better performance\. | 
| Inbound or outbound rules per security group  | 60 | [Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-0EA8095F) | You can have 60 inbound and 60 outbound rules per security group \(making a total of 120 rules\)\. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 rules and IPv6 rules; for example, a security group can have 60 inbound rules for IPv4 traffic and 60 inbound rules for IPv6 traffic\. A quota change applies to both inbound and outbound rules\. This quota multiplied by the quota for security groups per network interface cannot exceed 1,000\.  |

|  VPC endpoint policy size  | 20,480 characters | No | This quota includes white space\. | 

The following maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) rules apply to traffic that passes through a VPC endpoint\.
+ The maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) of a network connection is the size, in bytes, of the largest permissible packet that can be passed through the VPC endpoint\. The larger the MTU, the more data that can be passed in a single packet\. A VPC endpoint supports an MTU of 8500 bytes\.
+ Packets with a size larger than 8500 bytes that arrive at the VPC endpoint are dropped\.
+ The VPC endpoint does not generate the FRAG\_NEEDEDICMP packet, so Path MTU Discovery \(PMTUD\) is not supported\.
+ The VPC endpoint enforces Maximum Segment Size \(MSS\) clamping for all packets\. For more information, see [RFC879](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc879)\.

## VPC sharing<a name="vpc-share-limits"></a>

All standard VPC quotas apply to a shared VPC\.

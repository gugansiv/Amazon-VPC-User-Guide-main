# How Amazon VPC works<a name="how-it-works"></a>

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined\. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS\.

## VPCs and subnets<a name="how-it-works-subnet"></a>

A *virtual private cloud* \(VPC\) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account\. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud\. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC\. You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, associate security groups, and configure route tables\.

A *subnet* is a range of IP addresses in your VPC\. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet\. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet\.

To protect the AWS resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists \(ACL\)\.

You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, and assign IPv6 addresses to the instances in your VPC\.

## Default and nondefault VPCs<a name="what-is-default-nondefault"></a>

If your account was created after 2013\-12\-04, it comes with a *default VPC* that has a *default subnet* in each Availability Zone\. A default VPC has the benefits of the advanced features provided by EC2\-VPC, and is ready for you to use\. If you have a default VPC and don't specify a subnet when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into your default VPC\. You can launch instances into your default VPC without needing to know anything about Amazon VPC\. 

You can also create your own VPC, and configure it as you need\. This is known as a *nondefault VPC*\. Subnets that you create in your nondefault VPC and additional subnets that you create in your default VPC are called *nondefault subnets*\.

## IP addressing<a name="vpc-ip-addressing"></a>

IP addresses enable resources in your VPC to communicate with each other, and with resources over the internet\.

When you create a VPC, you assign it an IPv4 CIDR block \(a range of private IPv4 addresses\), an IPv6 CIDR block, or both \(dual\-stack\)\. Private IPv4 addresses are not reachable over the internet\. IPv6 addresses are globally unique and can be configured to remain private or reachable over the internet\.

Your VPC can operate in dual\-stack mode\. This means that your resources can communicate over IPv4, IPv6, or both IPv4 and IPv6\. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are independent of each other; you must add separate routes and security group rules for IPv4 and IPv6\.

### Private IPv4 addresses<a name="vpc-private-ipv4-addresses"></a>

Private IPv4 addresses \(also referred to as *private IP addresses* in this topic\) are not reachable over the internet, and can be used for communication between the instances in your VPC\. When you launch an instance into a VPC, a primary private IP address from the IPv4 address range of the subnet is assigned to the default network interface \(eth0\) of the instance\. Each instance is also given a private \(internal\) DNS hostname that resolves to the private IP address of the instance\. The hostname can be of two types: resource\-based or IP\-based\. For more information, see [EC2 instance naming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-naming.html)\. If you don't specify a primary private IP address, we select an available IP address in the subnet range for you\. For more information about network interfaces, see [Elastic Network Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

You can assign additional private IP addresses, known as secondary private IP addresses, to instances that are running in a VPC\. Unlike a primary private IP address, you can reassign a secondary private IP address from one network interface to another\. A private IP address remains associated with the network interface when the instance is stopped and restarted, and is released when the instance is terminated\. For more information about primary and secondary IP addresses, see [Multiple IP Addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

We refer to private IP addresses as the IP addresses that are within the IPv4 CIDR range of the VPC\. Most VPC IP address ranges fall within the private \(non\-publicly routable\) IP address ranges specified in RFC 1918; however, you can use publicly routable CIDR blocks for your VPC\. Regardless of the IP address range of your VPC, we do not support direct access to the internet from your VPC's CIDR block, including a publicly\-routable CIDR block\. You must set up internet access through a gateway; for example, an internet gateway, virtual private gateway, a AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect\.

### Public IPv4 addresses<a name="vpc-public-ipv4-addresses"></a>

All subnets have an attribute that determines whether a network interface created in the subnet automatically receives a public IPv4 address \(also referred to as a *public IP address* in this topic\)\. Therefore, when you launch an instance into a subnet that has this attribute enabled, a public IP address is assigned to the primary network interface \(eth0\) that's created for the instance\. A public IP address is mapped to the primary private IP address through network address translation \(NAT\)\. 

You can control whether your instance receives a public IP address by doing the following: 
+ Modifying the public IP addressing attribute of your subnet\. For more information, see [Modify the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet](working-with-subnets.md#subnet-public-ip)\.
+ Enabling or disabling the public IP addressing feature during instance launch, which overrides the subnet's public IP addressing attribute\.

A public IP address is assigned from Amazon's pool of public IP addresses; it's not associated with your account\. When a public IP address is disassociated from your instance, it's released back into the pool, and is no longer available for you to use\. You cannot manually associate or disassociate a public IP address\. Instead, in certain cases, we release the public IP address from your instance, or assign it a new one\. For more information, see [Public IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

If you require a persistent public IP address allocated to your account that can be assigned to and removed from instances as you require, use an Elastic IP address instead\. For more information, see [Associate Elastic IP addresses with resources in your VPC](vpc-eips.md)\.

If your VPC is enabled to support DNS hostnames, each instance that receives a public IP address or an Elastic IP address is also given a public DNS hostname\. We resolve a public DNS hostname to the public IP address of the instance outside the instance network, and to the private IP address of the instance from within the instance network\. For more information, see [DNS attributes for your VPC](vpc-dns.md)\.

### IPv6 addresses<a name="vpc-ipv6-addresses"></a>

You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets\. For more information, see [Associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your subnet](working-with-subnets.md#subnet-associate-ipv6-cidr)\.

Your instance in a VPC receives an IPv6 address if an IPv6 CIDR block is associated with your VPC and your subnet, and if one of the following is true:
+ Your subnet is configured to automatically assign an IPv6 address to the primary network interface of an instance during launch\.
+ You manually assign an IPv6 address to your instance during launch\.
+ You assign an IPv6 address to your instance after launch\.
+ You assign an IPv6 address to a network interface in the same subnet, and attach the network interface to your instance after launch\. 

When your instance receives an IPv6 address during launch, the address is associated with the primary network interface \(eth0\) of the instance\. You can disassociate the IPv6 address from the primary network interface\. We do not support IPv6 DNS hostnames for your instance\.

An IPv6 address persists when you stop and start your instance, and is released when you terminate your instance\. You cannot reassign an IPv6 address while it's assigned to another network interface—you must first unassign it\.

You can assign additional IPv6 addresses to your instance by assigning them to a network interface attached to your instance\. The number of IPv6 addresses you can assign to a network interface, and the number of network interfaces you can attach to an instance varies per instance type\. For more information, see [IP Addresses Per Network Interface Per Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\.

IPv6 addresses are globally unique and can be configured to remain private or reachable over the Internet\. You can control whether instances are reachable via their IPv6 addresses by controlling the routing for your subnet, or by using security group and network ACL rules\. For more information, see [Internetwork traffic privacy in Amazon VPC](VPC_Security.md)\.

For more information about reserved IPv6 address ranges, see [IANA IPv6 Special\-Purpose Address Registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml) and [RFC4291](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291)\.

### Use your own IP addresses<a name="vpc-using-own-ip-address"></a>

You can bring part or all of your own public IPv4 address range or IPv6 address range to your AWS account\. You continue to own the address range, but AWS advertises it on the internet by default\. After you bring the address range to AWS, it appears in your account as an address pool\. You can create an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, and you can associate an IPv6 CIDR block from your IPv6 address pool with a VPC\.

For more information, see [Bring your own IP addresses \(BYOIP\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## Route tables<a name="what-is-route-tables"></a>

A *route table* contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your VPC is directed\. You can explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table\. Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table\.

Each route in a route table specifies the range of IP addresses where you want the traffic to go \(the destination\) and the gateway, network interface, or connection through which to send the traffic \(the target\)\.

+ [Configure route tables](VPC_Route_Tables.md)

## Access the internet<a name="what-is-connectivity"></a>

You control how the instances that you launch into a VPC access resources outside the VPC\.

A default VPC includes an internet gateway, and each default subnet is a public subnet\. Each instance that you launch into a default subnet has a private IPv4 address and a public IPv4 address\. These instances can communicate with the internet through the internet gateway\. An internet gateway enables your instances to connect to the internet through the Amazon EC2 network edge\. 

By default, each instance that you launch into a nondefault subnet has a private IPv4 address, but no public IPv4 address, unless you specifically assign one at launch, or you modify the subnet's public IP address attribute\. These instances can communicate with each other, but can't access the internet\.

You can enable internet access for an instance launched into a nondefault subnet by attaching an internet gateway to its VPC \(if its VPC is not a default VPC\) and associating an Elastic IP address with the instance\.

Alternatively, to allow an instance in your VPC to initiate outbound connections to the internet but prevent unsolicited inbound connections from the internet, you can use a network address translation \(NAT\) device\. NAT maps multiple private IPv4 addresses to a single public IPv4 address\. You can configure the NAT device with an Elastic IP address and connect it to the internet through an internet gateway\. This makes it possible for an instance in a private subnet to connect to the internet through the NAT device, routing traffic from the instance to the internet gateway and any responses to the instance\.

If you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and assign IPv6 addresses to your instances, instances can connect to the internet over IPv6 through an internet gateway\. Alternatively, instances can initiate outbound connections to the internet over IPv6 using an egress\-only internet gateway\. IPv6 traffic is separate from IPv4 traffic; your route tables must include separate routes for IPv6 traffic\.

## Access a corporate or home network<a name="what-is-vpn"></a>

You can optionally connect your VPC to your own corporate data center using an IPsec AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN connection, making the AWSCloud an extension of your data center\.

A Site\-to\-Site VPN connection consists of two VPN tunnels between a virtual private gateway or transit gateway on the AWS side, and a customer gateway device located in your data center\. A customer gateway device is a physical device or software appliance that you configure on your side of the Site\-to\-Site VPN connection\.

+ [Transit Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html)

## Connect VPCs and networks<a name="vpc-other-networks"></a>

You can create a *VPC peering connection* between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately\. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network\.

You can also create a *transit gateway* and use it to interconnect your VPCs and on\-premises networks\. The transit gateway acts as a Regional virtual router for traffic flowing between its attachments, which can include VPCs, VPN connections, AWS Direct Connect gateways, and transit gateway peering connections\.

## AWS private global network considerations<a name="what-is-aws-global-network"></a>

AWS provides a high\-performance, and low\-latency private global network that delivers a secure cloud computing environment to support your networking needs\. AWS Regions are connected to multiple Internet Service Providers \(ISPs\) as well as to a private global network backbone, which provides improved network performance for cross\-Region traffic sent by customers\.

The following considerations apply:
+ Traffic that is in an Availability Zone, or between Availability Zones in all Regions, routes over the AWS private global network\.
+ Traffic that is between Regions always routes over the AWS private global network, except for China Regions\.

Network packet loss can be caused by a number of factors, including network flow collisions, lower level \(Layer 2\) errors, and other network failures\. We engineer and operate our networks to minimize packet loss\. We measure packet\-loss rate \(PLR\) across the global backbone that connects the AWS Regions\. We operate our backbone network to target a p99 of the hourly PLR of less than 0\.0001%\.

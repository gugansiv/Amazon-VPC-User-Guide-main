## Routing to an internet gateway<a name="route-tables-internet-gateway"></a>

You can make a subnet a public subnet by adding a route in your subnet route table to an internet gateway\. To do this, create and attach an internet gateway to your VPC, and then add a route with a destination of `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4 traffic or `::/0` for IPv6 traffic, and a target of the internet gateway ID \(`igw-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`\)\. 


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | igw\-id | 
| ::/0 | igw\-id | 

For more information, see [Connect to the internet using an internet gateway](VPC_Internet_Gateway.md)\.

## Routing to a NAT device<a name="route-tables-nat"></a>

To enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet, you can create a NAT gateway or launch a NAT instance in a public subnet\. Then add a route for the private subnet's route table that routes IPv4 internet traffic \(`0.0.0.0/0`\) to the NAT device\. 


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | nat\-gateway\-id | 

You can also create more specific routes to other targets to avoid unnecessary data processing charges for using a NAT gateway, or to route certain traffic privately\. In the following example, Amazon S3 traffic \(pl\-xxxxxxxx; a specific IP address range for Amazon S3\) is routed to a gateway VPC endpoint, and 10\.25\.0\.0/16 traffic is routed to a VPC peering connection\. The pl\-xxxxxxxx and 10\.25\.0\.0/16 IP address ranges are more specific than 0\.0\.0\.0/0\. When instances send traffic to Amazon S3 or the peer VPC, the traffic is sent to the gateway VPC endpoint or the VPC peering connection\. All other traffic is sent to the NAT gateway\. 


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | nat\-gateway\-id | 
| pl\-xxxxxxxx | vpce\-id | 
| 10\.25\.0\.0/16 | pcx\-id | 

For more information, see [NAT gateways](vpc-nat-gateway.md) and [NAT instances](VPC_NAT_Instance.md)\. NAT devices cannot be used for IPv6 traffic\.

## Routing to a virtual private gateway<a name="route-tables-vgw"></a>

You can use an AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN connection to enable instances in your VPC to communicate with your own network\. To do this, create and attach a virtual private gateway to your VPC\. Then add a route in your subnet route table with the destination of your network and a target of the virtual private gateway \(`vgw-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`\)\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 10\.0\.0\.0/16 | vgw\-id | 

You can then create and configure your Site\-to\-Site VPN connection\. For more information, see [What is AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) and [Route tables and VPN route priority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPNRoutingTypes.html#vpn-route-priority) in the *AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide*\.

A Site\-to\-Site VPN connection on a virtual private gateway does not support IPv6 traffic\. However, we support IPv6 traffic routed through a virtual private gateway to an AWS Direct Connect connection\. For more information, see the [AWS Direct Connect User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/)\.

## Routing to an AWS Outposts local gateway<a name="route-tables-lgw"></a>

Subnets that are in VPCs associated with AWS Outposts can have an additional target type of a local gateway\. Consider the case where you want to have the local gateway route traffic with a destination address of 192\.168\.10\.0/24 to the customer network\. To do this, add the following route with the destination network and a target of the local gateway \(`lgw-xxxx`\)\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 192\.168\.10\.0/24 | lgw\-id | 

## Routing to a VPC peering connection<a name="route-tables-vpc-peering"></a>

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that allows you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses\. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are part of the same network\. 

To enable the routing of traffic between VPCs in a VPC peering connection, you must add a route to one or more of your subnet route tables that points to the VPC peering connection\. This allows you to access all or part of the CIDR block of the other VPC in the peering connection\. Similarly, the owner of the other VPC must add a route to their subnet route table to route traffic back to your VPC\.

For example, you have a VPC peering connection \(`pcx-11223344556677889`\) between two VPCs, with the following information:
+ VPC A: CIDR block is 10\.0\.0\.0/16
+ VPC B: CIDR block is 172\.31\.0\.0/16

To enable traffic between the VPCs and allow access to the entire IPv4 CIDR block of either VPC, the VPC A route table is configured as follows\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 10\.0\.0\.0/16 | Local | 
| 172\.31\.0\.0/16 | pcx\-11223344556677889 | 

The VPC B route table is configured as follows\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 172\.31\.0\.0/16 | Local | 
| 10\.0\.0\.0/16 | pcx\-11223344556677889 | 

Your VPC peering connection can also support IPv6 communication between instances in the VPCs, if the VPCs and instances are enabled for IPv6 communication\. To enable the routing of IPv6 traffic between VPCs, you must add a route to your route table that points to the VPC peering connection to access all or part of the IPv6 CIDR block of the peer VPC\.

For example, using the same VPC peering connection \(`pcx-11223344556677889`\) above, assume the VPCs have the following information:
+ VPC A: IPv6 CIDR block is `2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56`
+ VPC B: IPv6 CIDR block is `2001:db8:5678:2b00::/56`

To enable IPv6 communication over the VPC peering connection, add the following route to the subnet route table for VPC A\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 10\.0\.0\.0/16 | Local | 
| 172\.31\.0\.0/16 | pcx\-11223344556677889 | 
| 2001:db8:5678:2b00::/56 | pcx\-11223344556677889 | 

Add the following route to the route table for VPC B\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 172\.31\.0\.0/16 | Local | 
| 10\.0\.0\.0/16 | pcx\-11223344556677889 | 
| 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56 | pcx\-11223344556677889 | 

For more information about VPC peering connections, see the [Amazon VPC Peering Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/)\.

## Routing to a gateway VPC endpoint<a name="route-tables-vpce"></a>

A gateway VPC endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and another AWS service\. When you create a gateway endpoint, you specify the subnet route tables in your VPC that are used by the gateway endpoint\. A route is automatically added to each of the route tables with a destination that specifies the prefix list ID of the service \(`pl-xxxxxxxx`\), and a target with the endpoint ID \(`vpce-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`\)\. You cannot explicitly delete or modify the endpoint route, but you can change the route tables that are used by the endpoint\.

For more information about routing for endpoints, and the implications for routes to AWS services, see [Routing for gateway endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway.html#vpc-endpoints-routing)\.

## Routing to an egress\-only internet gateway<a name="route-tables-eigw"></a>

You can create an egress\-only internet gateway for your VPC to enable instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound communication to the internet, but prevent the internet from initiating connections with the instances\. An egress\-only internet gateway is used for IPv6 traffic only\. To configure routing for an egress\-only internet gateway, add a route in the private subnet's route table that routes IPv6 internet traffic \(`::/0`\) to the egress\-only internet gateway\. 


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| ::/0 | eigw\-id | 

For more information, see [Enable outbound IPv6 traffic using an egress\-only internet gateway](egress-only-internet-gateway.md)\.

## Routing for a transit gateway<a name="route-tables-tgw"></a>

When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, you need to add a route to your subnet route table for traffic to route through the transit gateway\. 

Consider the following scenario where you have three VPCs that are attached to a transit gateway\. In this scenario, all attachments are associated with the transit gateway route table and propagate to the transit gateway route table\. Therefore, all attachments can route packets to each other, with the transit gateway serving as a simple layer 3 IP hub\. 

For example, you have two VPCs, with the following information:
+ VPC A: 10\.1\.0\.0/16, attachment ID tgw\-attach\-11111111111111111
+ VPC B: 10\.2\.0\.0/16, attachment ID tgw\-attach\-22222222222222222

To enable traffic between the VPCs and allow access to the transit gateway, the VPC A route table is configured as follows\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 10\.1\.0\.0/16 | local | 
| 10\.0\.0\.0/8 | tgw\-id | 

The following is an example of the transit gateway route table entries for the VPC attachments\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 10\.1\.0\.0/16 | tgw\-attach\-11111111111111111 | 
| 10\.2\.0\.0/16 | tgw\-attach\-22222222222222222 | 

For more information about transit gateway route tables, see [Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/how-transit-gateways-work.html#tgw-routing-overview) in *Amazon VPC Transit Gateways*\.

## Routing for a middlebox appliance<a name="route-tables-appliance-routing"></a>

You can add middlebox appliances into the routing paths for your VPC\. The following are possible use cases:
+ Intercept traffic that enters your VPC through an internet gateway or a virtual private gateway by directing it to a middlebox appliance in your VPC\. You can use the middlebox routing wizard to have AWS automatically configure the appropriate route tables for your gateway, middlebox, and destination subnet\. For more information, see [Work with the middlebox routing wizard](middlebox-routing-console.md)\.
+ Direct traffic between two subnets to a middlebox appliance\. You can do so by creating a route for one subnet route table that matches the subnet CIDR of the other subnet and specifies a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, NAT gateway, Network Firewall endpoint, or the network interface for an appliance as a target\. Alternatively, to redirect all traffic from the subnet to any other subnet, replace the target of the local route with a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, NAT gateway, or network interface\.

You can configure the appliance to suit your needs\. For example, you can configure a security appliance that screens all traffic, or a WAN acceleration appliance\. The appliance is deployed as an Amazon EC2 instance in a subnet in your VPC, and is represented by an elastic network interface \(network interface\) in your subnet\.

If you enable route propagation for the destination subnet route table, be aware of route priority\. We prioritize the most specific route, and if the routes match, we prioritize static routes over propagated routes\. Review your routes to ensure that traffic is routed correctly and that there are no unintended consequences if you enable or disable route propagation \(for example, route propagation is required for an AWS Direct Connect connection that supports jumbo frames\)\.

To route inbound VPC traffic to an appliance, you associate a route table with the internet gateway or virtual private gateway, and specify the network interface of your appliance as the target for VPC traffic\. For more information, see [Gateway route tables](VPC_Route_Tables.md#gateway-route-tables)\. You can also route outbound traffic from your subnet to a middlebox appliance in another subnet\.

For middlebox routing examples, see [Middlebox routing scenarios](middlebox-routing-examples.md)\.

+ [Routing traffic between a gateway and an appliance](#appliance-routing-configuration)
+ [Routing inter\-subnet traffic to an appliance](#appliance-routing-configuration-inter-subnet)

### Appliance considerations<a name="appliance-considerations"></a>

You can choose a third\-party appliance from [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace), or you can configure your own appliance\. When you create or configure an appliance, take note of the following:
+ The appliance must be configured in a separate subnet to the source or destination traffic\.
+ You must disable source/destination checking on the appliance\. For more information, see [Changing the Source or Destination Checking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#change_source_dest_check) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
+ You cannot route traffic between hosts in the same subnet through an appliance\.
+ The appliance does not have to perform network address translation \(NAT\)\.
+ You can add a route to your route tables that is more specific than the local route\. You can use more specific routes to redirect traffic between subnets within a VPC \(East\-West traffic\) to a middlebox appliance\. The destination of the route must match the entire IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block of a subnet in your VPC\.
+ To intercept IPv6 traffic, ensure that you configure your VPC, subnet, and appliance for IPv6\. For more information, see [Work with VPCs](working-with-vpcs.md)\. Virtual private gateways do not support IPv6 traffic\.

### Routing traffic between a gateway and an appliance<a name="appliance-routing-configuration"></a>

To route inbound VPC traffic to an appliance, you associate a route table with the internet gateway or virtual private gateway, and specify the network interface of your appliance as the target for VPC traffic\. In the following example, the VPC has an internet gateway, an appliance, and a subnet with instances\. Traffic from the internet is routed through an appliance\.

![\[Routing inbound traffic through an appliance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/images/gateway-appliance-routing.png)

Associate this route table with your internet gateway or virtual private gateway\. The first entry is the local route\. The second entry sends IPv4 traffic destined for the subnet to the network interface for the appliance\. This route is more specific than the local route\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC CIDR | Local | 
| Subnet CIDR | Appliance network interface ID | 

Alternatively, you can replace the target for the local route with the network interface of the appliance\. You can do this to ensure that all traffic is automatically routed to the appliance, including traffic destined for subnets that you add to the VPC in the future\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC CIDR | Appliance network interface ID | 

To route traffic from your subnet to an appliance in another subnet, add a route to your subnet route table that routes traffic to the appliance's network interface\. The destination must be less specific than the destination for the local route\. For example, for traffic destined for the internet, specify `0.0.0.0/0` \(all IPv4 addresses\) for the destination\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC CIDR | Local | 
| 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | Appliance network interface ID | 

Then, in the route table associated with the appliance's subnet, add a route that sends the traffic back to the internet gateway or virtual private gateway\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC CIDR | Local | 
| 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | igw\-id | 

### Routing inter\-subnet traffic to an appliance<a name="appliance-routing-configuration-inter-subnet"></a>

You can route traffic destined for a specific subnet to the network interface of an appliance\. In the following example, the VPC contains two subnets and an appliance\. Traffic between the subnets is routed through an appliance\.

![\[Routing traffic between subnets through an appliance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/images/inter-subnet-appliance-routing.png)

**Security groups**  
When you route traffic between instances in different subnets through a middlebox appliance, the security groups for both instances must allow traffic to flow between the instances\. The security group for each instance must reference the private IP address of the other instance, or the CIDR range of the subnet that contains the other instance, as the source\. If you reference the security group of the other instance as the source, this does not allow traffic to flow between the instances\.

**Routing**  
The following is an example route table for subnet A\. The first entry enables instances in the VPC to communicate with each other\. The second entry routes all traffic from subnet A to subnet B to the network interface of the appliance\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC CIDR | Local | 
| Subnet B CIDR | Appliance network interface ID | 

The following is an example route table for subnet B\. The first entry enables instances in the VPC to communicate with each other\. The second entry routes all traffic from subnet B to subnet A to the network interface of the appliance\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC CIDR | Local | 
| Subnet A CIDR | Appliance network interface ID | 

Alternatively, you can replace the target for the local route with the network interface of the appliance\. You can do this to ensure that all traffic is automatically routed to the appliance, including traffic destined for subnets that you add to the VPC in the future\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC CIDR | Appliance network interface ID | 

## Routing using a prefix list<a name="route-tables-managed-prefix-list"></a>

If you frequently reference the same set of CIDR blocks across your AWS resources, you can create a [customer\-managed prefix list](managed-prefix-lists.md) to group them together\. You can then specify the prefix list as the destination in your route table entry\. You can later add or remove entries for the prefix list without needing to update your route tables\.

For example, you have a transit gateway with multiple VPC attachments\. The VPCs must be able to communicate with two specific VPC attachments that have the following CIDR blocks:
+ 10\.0\.0\.0/16
+ 10\.2\.0\.0/16

You create a prefix list with both entries\. In your subnet route tables, you create a route and specify the prefix list as the destination, and the transit gateway as the target\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 172\.31\.0\.0/16 | Local | 
| pl\-123abc123abc123ab | tgw\-id | 

The maximum number of entries for the prefix lists equals the same number of entries in the route table\.

## Routing to a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint<a name="route-tables-gwlbe"></a>

A Gateway Load Balancer enables you to distribute traffic to a fleet of virtual appliances, such as firewalls\. You can configure the load balancer as a service by creating a [VPC endpoint service configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoint-services-gwlbe.html)\. You then create a [Gateway Load Balancer endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway-load-balancer.html) in your VPC to connect your VPC to the service\.

To route your traffic to the Gateway Load Balancer \(for example, for security inspection\), specify the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint as a target in your route tables\.

For an example of a security appliances behind a Gateway Load Balancer, see [Security appliances behind a Gateway Load Balancer in the security VPC ](gwlb-route.md)\.

To specify the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint in the route table, use the ID of the VPC endpoint\. For example to route traffic for 10\.0\.1\.0/24 to a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, add the following route\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| 10\.0\.1\.0/24 | vpc\-endpoint\-id | 

For more information, see [Gateway Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/gateway/introduction.html)\.
